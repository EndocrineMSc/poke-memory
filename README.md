# Pokemon Memory Card App

This app is a game, challenging your memory with clickable Pokemon Cards in the Browser.
It was made using **React** and hosted using **Vercel**.

The project was made during the course of **The Odin Project** in order to deepen understanding of the **React** library, especially using the useEffect hook.

Pokemon images and names are fetched using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).
