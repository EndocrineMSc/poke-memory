# Pokemon Memory Card App

This app is a game, challenging your memory with clickable Pokemon Cards in the Browser.
It was made using **React** and hosted using **Vercel**.

The project was made during the course of **The Odin Project** in order to deepen understanding of the **React** library, especially using the useEffect hook.

Pokémon images and names are fetched using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## How to install

Clone the project, install dependencies with npm and open in VSCode

## Game Rules

Click as many Pokémon cards as you can, but do not click any twice.
After each click a new set of 10 Pokémon will be displayed, randomly chosen from the first generation of Pokémon Games (a.k.a Global Pokédex Entries 1-150).
Your Highscore will be saved in the local storage of your browser if it isn't disabled.

I obviously do not own any of the rights of anything to do with Pokémon and I am only using the publicly available API for this game, which was only made for learning.
